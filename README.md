# Type Challenges

Type challenge roadmap and solutions with explanations from this repo: https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges

I struggled through doing the challenges in order so you don't have to! Lots of these challenges build on one another, and reference materials can be hard to find, so I decided to compile it all here.

There are categories and a recommended order to work through each, but don't be scared to jump through categories as you see fit.

## Get started

Use this challenge to warm up and make sure the testing types are working, then get into some of the categories!
