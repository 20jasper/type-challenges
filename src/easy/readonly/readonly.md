### Explanation
We need to create a new object type with readonly properties
```ts
type MyReadonly<Type> = /* ... */
```

#### Lookup types
To get the type of the keys (keys are also known as indexed access types or lookup types) in `Chair`, we can use square bracket notation just like accessing a property or method in a JavaScript object

```ts
type Chair = {
	color: string,
	legCount: number,
	isComfortable: boolean
}

Chair["color"] // string
Chair["legCount"] // number
```
Note that only types can be used for indexing
```ts
const key = "color"
Chair[key] // Type "key" cannot be used as an index type
```

#### Mapped Types
We can set each property of `Type` to readonly by iterating through a union of its `PropertyKeys`, which can be created with `keyof`

```ts
type MyReadonly<Type> = {
	readonly [Key in keyof Type]: Type[Key]
}

type ReadonlyChair = MyReadonly<Chair>
/*
type ReadonlyChair = {
    readonly color: string;
    readonly legCount: number;
    readonly isComfortable: boolean;
}
*/
```
Note that `Key` in this example is a parameter, so it is just a placeholder name. It could be called `Property` or `Jimothy` and work just as well

### Conclusion

Congratulationsâ€”you now have a typesafe pick function!
